The book has been been highly influential. According to its publishing house, [it sold more than 2 million copies](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/690485/nudge-by-richard-h-thaler-and-cass-r-sunstein/). It, arguably, paved the way for behavioral public policy.

A second--or in the words of the authors, a "final"--edition has been published in 2021. We fact-checked the original, first publication of 2008.
