“Half the students in a class are given coffee mugs with the insignia of their home university embossed on it. The students who do not get a mug are asked to examine their neighbor’s mugs. Then mug owners are invited to sell their mugs and nonowners are invited to buy them. They do so by answering the question “At each of the following prices, indicate whether you would be willing to (give up your mug/buy a mug).” The results show that those with mugs demand roughly twice as much to give up their mugs as others are willing to pay to get one.”(p.33)

I wanted to fact check the strongness of the experiment described above. The author mentioned the names of Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler (1991). After checking their articles and studies, I realized that their work was quoted more than 6 000 times in articles about Gain and Losses.
