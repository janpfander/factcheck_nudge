**Context**: The author used that false fact to emphasize the importance and utility of organ donations.

According to Dr. Johnny C. Hong, an internationally recognized multi-organ transplanter [@johnnyc] we can donate up to many as 8 organs (<https://pennstatehealthnews.org/2024/04/the-medical-minute-six-organ-donation-facts-knock-down-six-myths/>). It is the same information we can find through national organ donations organizations\^\[France: <https://ffdsb.org/comprendre-les-autres-dons/don-de-tissus-et-dorganes/>; United States: <https://www.cdc.gov/transplant-safety/about/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/transplantsafety/overview/key-facts.html>; WHO: <https://www.who.int/health-topics/transplantation#tab=tab_1>\]. A diseased organ donor can indeed give kidney(2), liver, heart, lung(2), pancreas and small intestine. Following his deduction we with thousand donors we could save as many as three eight thousand lives.
