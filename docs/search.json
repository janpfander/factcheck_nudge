    "text": "Paying endlessly for subscriptions\n\nBy: Ariane\n\n\n“Free subscriptions seem like a bargain, even if the magazines rarely get read, so Sunstein happily made his choices. What he didn’t realize was that unless he took some action to cancel his subscription, he would continue to receive the magazines, paying for them at the normal rate. For about a decade, he has continued to subscribe to magazines that he hardly ever reads. (…) One of the causes of status quo bias is a lack of attention. Many people adopt what we will call the “yeah, whatever” heuristic.” (p.35)\n\nThe example of the subscription to a payable newspaper is not working in all situations because of the socioeconomic dimension of it. This reasoning works only for people who have a comfortable way of life, who can pay for a newspaper they even don’t read, who don’t take the time to check where money goes and so on. In all this part of the book, the author makes an abstraction of the socioeconomic constraints which modulate the status quo bias.\nSeveral studies observe the effect of the status quo bias on different cases. One of them is about the influence of social capital : the greater you have, the more you are in a situation where you can exchange information, learn and revise your practices in front of a status quo bias.\nHowever, we can consider the status quo bias as a powerful nudge, but we have to keep in mind that it works for the people that are in the middle of the population.\n\n\nDo gay men underestimate AIDS risk?\n\nBy: Taïna\n\n\n“Gay men systematically underestimate the chance that they will contract AIDS, even though they know about AIDS risks in general” (p.XX)\n\n\nonly data are about : Health Optimism (α = 0.791) and Transmission Optimism (α = 0.795)\ntechnical knowledge, experience, desire, and attitudes to risk may all affect how people respond and often in multiple, sometimes contradictory, directions.\nHIV optimism should be complemented by analysis of the complexities of individuals’ assessments of both risk and pleasure in specific sexual contexts.\n\n[study of n=122 men] No effect on unrealistic optimism was found.

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThis part of the book is about how our choices and behavior are influenced by others. According to the authors, we tend to sometimes mindlessly copy the behavior of family, friends, or even strangers. The authors argue that people’s susceptibility to social norms can be used to design nudges, and tackle problems such as obesity. (by Adèle)\n\n\n\nJim Jones and the People’s Temple\n\nBy: Jules\n\n\n“The Reverend Jim Jones was the founder and leader of the People’s Temple. In 1978 Jones, facing charges of tax evasion, moved most of his one thousand followers from San Francisco to a small settlement in Guyana, which he named Jonestown. Facing a federal investigation for reported acts of child abuse and torture, Jones decided that his followers should poison their children and then themselves. They prepared vats of poison. A few people resisted; a few others shouted out their protest, but they were silenced. Following Jones’s orders, and the social pressures imposed by one another, mothers and fathers duly poisoned their children. Then they poisoned themselves. Their bodies were found arm in arm, lying together.” (p.51)\n\nA few pieces of information aren’t very clear :\n\nFirstly, Jones and his followers had a tax audit during summer 1977, and decided just after to move to the place they will name Jonestown. They were already settled there in 1978, when in november, Leo Rayan, a representative of California, was sent by the government to investigate following complaints lodged by relatives of members of the People’s Temple, concerning living conditions potentially infringing human rights (https://www.lefigaro.fr/histoire/archives/2018/11/16/26010-20181116ARTFIG00300-jonestown-massacre-des-adeptes-du-temple-du-peuple-il-y-a-40-ans.php).\nApparently, several of the victims were forced at gunpoint to absorb the poison mixed with a synthetic drink called ‘kool aid’, and poured into a bathtub from which everyone drew. What’s more, some mothers administered the poison to their babies themselves.\nFanatics of the sect fired some people who didn’t want to apply the “pact of death” they signed during the adhesion to the “Temple”.\nThey didn’t all die, approximately 80 managed to survive, escaping in the Jungle.\nJones was found dead, a bullet in the head.\n\nIn conclusion, they were not all killed by social influence but also by coercion, some were forced to commit suicide by armed threats, and others who refused were shot dead.\n\n\nWe don’t like songs only because others like them\n\nBy: Adèle\n\n\n“The identical song could be a hit or a failure simply because other people, at the start, were seen to choose to have downloaded it or not” (p.62)\n\nThis citation is implying that people will like a song only because other people liked it. He used it in order to demonstrate the impact of other behavior over ours.We will go through the veracity of this claim:\n\nHe based his sentence on a study : “Experimental Study of Inequality and Unpredictability in an Artificial Cultural Market ’’. However, he overacted the study, in fact the author mentioned « In general, the best songs never do very badly, and the worst songs never do extremely well, but almost any other result is possible” (Salganik, Dodds, and Watts 2006).\nThere are many other reasons why people like some songs more than others, and why they come to like them in the first place. An example are rhythm features: A lot of studies state a correlation between the rhythm features and the popularity of songs (Nijkamp, n.d.; Kim 2021). These two studies showed that they seem to be rhythm preferences shared by a lot of people, which could be an explanation of why we love the same song and also contradict the statement that identical songs could be a hit or a failure only regarding if people have downloaded it.\n\n\n\nCommunism because of pluralistic ignorance?\n\nBy: Lou-Anne\n\n\n“An important problem here is “pluralistic ignorance”—that is, ignorance, on the part of all or most, about what other people think. We may follow a practice or a tradition not because we like it, or even think it de- fensible, but merely because we think that most other people like it. Many social practices persist for this reason, and a small shock, or nudge, can dislodge them.6 A dramatic example is communism in the former Soviet bloc, which lasted in part because people were unaware how many people despised the regime. (p.59)”\n\nThe authors suggest that although the populism despised communism in the Soviet Union, it lasted because people were unaware of others’ feelings about it.\nBut is pluralistic ignorance really one of the reasons why communism, in the Soviet Union, lasted so long? First, let’s see the broad reasons why communism and the Soviet Union ended.\n\neconomic reasons: By the end of the 1980’s, the economy had deteriorated, with large budget debts and food and consumer goods shortages.\npolitical reasons : Mikhail Gorbachev became leader of the USSR on 11 March 1985, and established the policy of glasnost, which is free speech. The control of the press was relaxed and thousands of dissidents were released from prison. Glasnost had the effect of opening the whole Soviet system up to criticism. Before, people who expressed criticism of the regime had to fear punishment. In fact, it seems more plausible that people didn’t revolt because they were scared of consequences, rather than because they believed everyone else would appreciate that government.\n\nIs there a study that establishes a link between pluralistic ignorance and the support of communism? It is hard to say, but if we look at polls in Russia today, it seems that people today think that it wasn’t people’s disapproval which led to the USSR communist ideology.\n\nA 2016 survey, conducted by the Levada Center–a Russian independent, nongovernmental polling and sociological research organization–suggests that Russian people think that the main reasons for the collapse of USSR, were first “Yeltsin, Kravchuk, and Shushkevich’s irresponsible and unjustified Belovezha “conspiracy”” (29%), then “a conspiracy between foreign powers hostile to the USSR” (23%), and only third comes “the people’s dissatisfaction with the country’s leadership, M. Gorbachev and his associates” (21%). Moreover, the actual despising of communism (“The complete exhaustion of communist ideology”) comes sixth with 13%. We precise that people were allowed to select multiple responses.\nBy showing the actual perception of the Soviet Union and its collapse, this survey doesn’t clearly support or even goes against the claim that the despising of communism ideology was shared by a majority of the population.\nFinally, the author doesn’t base their claim on any study establishing the existence of pluralistic ignorance in the Soviet Union.\n\nTo sum up, one cannot really determine if communism in the Soviet Union lasted because of pluralistic ignorance, as it is difficult to establish how many people despised the regime and the real impact of pluralistic ignorance compared to other factors, for example political or economical reasons.\nReferences: https://sociologicalscience.com/download/vol-7/december/SocSci_v7_628to648.pdf https://www.levada.ru/en/2017/01/09/the-fall-of-the-soviet-union/ https://www.britannica.com/story/why-did-the-soviet-union-collapse https://www.stiftung-berliner-mauer.de/en/topics/berlin-wall\n\n\nDo teenagers get pregnant from looking at other teenagers?\n\nBy: Esther\n\n\n“Teenage girls who see that other teenagers are having children are more likely to become pregnant themselves.*” (p.55)\n\n\nThe impact of an older sister’s teenage pregnancy on a younger sister is stronger than the one of a maternal adolescent childbearing. → the older sister is closer to the younger. The study is significant because the original cohort consisted of 17,115 women born between 1979 and 1994 in Manitoba. (Wall-Wieler, Roos, and Nickel 2016)\nInfluence pregnancy for teenage girls. Friends have indeed a strong influence on behavior during adolescence and the peer pressure may increase the number of pregnant teenage girls. However, to measure friends’ influence, they only ask questions to each teenager. We can’t really rely on this.\nHowever, it appears that economic conditions have more impact on the pregnancy than peer influence. Indeed, poor people are more likely to be pregnant at younger age than the rich people. Those, because of education and facilities to contraception access, get less and older pregnant (Chung, Kim, and Lee 2018).\n\n\n\nSocial feasting\n\nBy: Ambre & Philibert\n\n\n“On average, those who eat with one other person eat about 35 percent more than they do when they are alone; members of a group of four eat about 75 percent more; those in groups of seven or more eat 96 percent more.” (p.52)\n\nHere, the authors aim to prove that people are easily influenced by others and will change their behaviour to escape peer pressure. This claim comes from John de Castro. He calls the phenomenon ‘social facilitation’ and conducted a study where 500 adults had to report everything they ate and with whom in a food diary.He found that “meals eaten with one other person present were 33% larger than meals eaten alone, whereas 47%, 58%, 69%, 70%, 72%, and 96% increases were associated with two, three, four, five, six, and seven or more people present, respectively.”\nSeveral issues in the study design prevent us from concluding that the presence of other people inclines us to eat more: - First, the effect was not observed when people did not know each other.\n\nSecond, the study lacked randomization: people were not randomly assigned to eat in a group of one, four or seven. So as a result, there is an obvious confounder between eating more and eating in a group: most of the time, when we gather in larger groups to eat, it is to celebrate something. So, the fact that we eat more than usual is not necessarily caused directly by being with more people - both being with people and eating more might be caused by the fact that we want to celebrate something.\n\nMore broadly, the author’s approach to public policy can be classified as “i-frame” (Chater and Loewenstein 2023). But in the domain of health and food (cf obesity problematics), focusing on individual-level causes and remedies for obesity risks displacing researcher time, financial resources, and journal pages from deeper thinking and in-depth research about what caused the obesity epidemic, about s-frame interventions to reverse it, and about how to marshal behavioral science to help make such interventions successful. Misattributing problems to individual weakness rather than systemic factors also implicitly blames individuals – and encourages them to blame themselves – for their inability to swim against powerful currents they have little hope of resisting.\nTo sum up, the initial study only finds a correlation between eating more and being with more people. But why we observe this correlation is not as clear as the authors of “Nudge” suggest - there are several possible causal explanations and future studies are needed.\n\n\nIs your obesity your friends’ fault?\n\nBy: Adèle\n\n\n“obesity is contagious; you’re more likely to be overweight if you have a lot of overweight friends” (p.64)\n\nContext: The authors stated this to demonstrate the importance of social influence over us and more precisely our health in that case.\n\nThere is a confounder, you and your friends are all living in the same country and the same city. Thus, you are subject to the same obesity characteristics, in fact, there is strong evidence that people who migrate often take on the obesity characteristics of their new locality (Schulz et al. 2006).\nMoreover, obesity “i-frame interventions have proven disappointing” (Chater and Loewenstein 2023) . Indeed, s-frame interventions are way more powerful than a nudge and self-incentives regarding obesity. Therefore, even if there is a nudge that with overweight friends you will be more likely to be overweight it is minimal regarding the country’s influence.\nMoreover, there is another confounder, everything is pushing us to be overweight, mostly due to the “food industry and agribusiness relentlessly lobby[ing] at the s-frame” (Barrett 2004) to make sure that states do not decrease people’s consumption of processed food, because consumption of them make them gain money.\n\n\n\nDo people change their minds easily depending on others?\n\nBy: Louise\n\n\n“People become more likely to conform when they know that other people will see what they have to say. Sometimes people will go along with the group even when they think, or know, that everyone else has blundered.”(p.57)\n\n\nAsch conformity experiments were a series of studies that examined how individuals were influenced by a majority group and the effect of such influences on beliefs and opinions. The exercise comprises a series of straightforward questions. Some actors respond in a manner that is demonstrably incorrect, while another individual is unaware of the fact that the others are actors. Having actors giving the wrong answer made the participant also give the wrong answer, even though they knew it was not correct. Two explanations have been proposed for this phenomenon: perceptual modification of the participant and conformism.\nThe prevalent explanation seems to be conformism. Indeed, when people respond in private or when some other people give the true answer, they are less following others, and stick to their first opinion. In reality, the majority of people adhere to the majority opinion, although they are generally aware of the situation. They do not act in a blind manner and are aware of the implications of their action. They follow the herd but not blindly (Mercier 2017).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBarrett, T. 2004. “CNN.com - House Bans Fast-Food Lawsuits - Mar 10, 2004.” https://edition.cnn.com/2004/LAW/03/10/fat.lawsuits/.\n\n\nChater, Nick, and George Loewenstein. 2023. “The i-Frame and the s-Frame: How Focusing on Individual-Level Solutions Has Led Behavioral Public Policy Astray.” Behavioral and Brain Sciences 46: e147. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X22002023.\n\n\nChung, Hye Won, Eun Mee Kim, and Ji-Eun Lee. 2018. “Comprehensive Understanding of Risk and Protective Factors Related to Adolescent Pregnancy in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review.” Journal of Adolescence 69 (1): 180–88. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adolescence.2018.10.007.\n\n\nKim, Jaehyun. 2021. “Music Popularity Prediction Through Data Analysis of Music’s Characteristics.” International Journal of Science, Technology and Society 9 (5): 239–44. https://doi.org/10.11648/j.ijsts.20210905.16.\n\n\nMercier, Hugo. 2017. “How Gullible Are We?

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThis chapter starts by explaining the two systems that we have when we think: the quick one that can provide innacurate information, and the slower one that is much more accurate. Then, the chapter goes deeper into the ‘Rules of Thumb’ that we use when we use the quick system to make decisions and to judge, and that explains why it can be innacurate. Examples include the rule of representativeness, and giving meaning to randomness. (by Natsha)\n\n\n\nStatus quo bias, really for all?\n\nBy: Ariane\n\n\nFree subscriptions seem like a bargain, even if the magazines rarely get read, so Sunstein happily made his choices. What he didn’t realize was that unless he took some action to cancel his subscription, he would continue to receive the magazines, paying for them at the normal rate. For about a decade, he has continued to subscribe to magazines that he hardly ever reads. (…) One of the causes of status quo bias is a lack of attention. Many people adopt what we will call the “yeah, whatever” heuristic.” (p.35)\n\n\nThis example happened in the context of the chapter Biases and blunders, when the status quo bias is demonstrated. According to Scribbr, “status quo bias refers to people’s preference for keeping things the way they currently are. Under status quo bias, people perceive change as a risk or a loss. Because of this, they try to maintain the current situation. This can impact the quality of their decisions.” (https://www.scribbr.com/research-bias/status-quo-bias/)\nThe example of the subscription to a payable newspaper is not working in all situations because of the socioeconomic dimension of it. This reasoning works only for people who have a comfortable way of life, who can pay for a newspaper they even don’t read, who don’t take the time to check where money goes and so on. In all this part of the book, the author makes an abstraction of the socioeconomic constraints which modulate the status quo bias.\nSeveral studies observe the effect of the status quo bias on different cases. For instance, the Foundation for Studies and Research on International Development (FERDI, https://hdl.handle.net/10419/269762) highlights the influence of social capital on the status quo bias : the greater you have, the more you are in a situation where you can exchange information, learn and revise your practices in front of a status quo bias. Thus we are less likely to have status quo bias if we have an important social capital.\nMoreover, if we are aware of the status quo bias, we will think more about it for every situation and it gives less influence to the status quo bias on our decision.\nIn conclusion, status quo bias matters, but we have to take into account that its influence depends on a lot of factors such as the socioeconomic conditions of the situation and the social capital of the individual.\n\n\n\nAccurate AIDS risk perceptions?\n\nBy: Taïna\n\n\n“Gay men systematically underestimate the chance that they will contract AIDS, even though they know about AIDS risks in general” (p.XX)\n\n\nonly data are about : Health Optimism (α = 0.791) and Transmission Optimism (α = 0.795)\ntechnical knowledge, experience, desire, and attitudes to risk may all affect how people respond and often in multiple, sometimes contradictory, directions.\nHIV optimism should be complemented by analysis of the complexities of individuals’ assessments of both risk and pleasure in specific sexual contexts.\n[study of n=122 men] No effect on unrealistic optimism was found. It seems that the cognitive account provides a better explanation than does the motivational account of at least that form of UO measured in this study. Implications for AIDS education are discussed.\nKnowledge of HIV status among gay men and other men who have sex with men who are living with HIV was three times higher in countries with the least repressive lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people (LGBT) laws than in countries with the most repressive LGBT laws (8).\nSurveys in sub-Saharan Africa found that between 10% and 40% of gay men and other men who have sex with men delay or avoid health care due to fear of stigma –&gt; gay men might not be “underestimating” the chance of getting aids, but fearing stigma.\nstigma and discrimination create barriers across the HIV prevention, testing and treatment cascades and reduce the impact of the AIDS response: “people living with HIV who perceive high levels of HIV-related stigma are 2.4 times more likely to delay enrolment in care until they are very ill (1). In eight countries with available data, more than a quarter of people living with HIV reported that they had avoided going to a local clinic in the previous 12 months because of their HIV status (Figure 1) (2). Such fears also discourage the uptake of prevention and testing services. For example, fear of the HIV-related stigma and discrimination that may result from an HIV-positive test result and having that result disclosed to others, either through self-disclosure or otherwise, has been identified as a disincentive to HIV testing in a range of settings (3, 4).”\n\n\n\nAssigning meaning to randomness\n\nBy: Natsha\n\n\n“Use of the representativeness heuristic can cause serious misperceptions of patterns in everyday life. When events are determined by chance, such as a sequence of coin tosses, people expect the resulting string of heads and tails to be representative of what they think of as random. […] You might flip a coin three times, see it come up heads every time, and conclude that there is something funny about the coin. But the fact is that if you flip any coin a lot, it won’t be so unusual to see three heads in a row.”(p.27)\n\nThe authors write that people tend to assign meaning to randomness even when there isn’t any.\n\nAlthough the authors do not provide a source, their finding is correct.\nThe authors use the example of the coin tosses to illustrate how inaccurate the perception of randomness is. However, the example of the coin is not based on any study; the sources are not cited.\nIn their seminal work on heuristics and biases, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky demonstrated how the representativeness heuristic can lead people to misjudge probabilities and see patterns even though they do not exist (Kahneman and Tversky 1972).\nTversky and Kahneman introduced the heuristics-and-biases (HB) research program with their research and were cited by 8841 papers on Google Scholar and were subject of meat-analyses such as “The heuristics-and-biases inventory: An open-source tool to explore individual differences in rationality” (Vincent Berthet, and Vincent de Gardelle, 2023).\nMore specifically, studies have been made on coin tosses and the perception of randomness. They have shown that people tend to erroneously rate sequences with less internal structure or order (such as HTTHT, with H being heads and T being tails) as more probable than sequences containing more structure or order (such as HHHHH) (Reimers, Donkin, and E. Le Pelley 2018).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nKahneman, Daniel, and Amos Tversky. 1972. “Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness.” https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-0285(72)90016-3.\n\n\nReimers, Stian, Chris Donkin, and Mike E.

In the current confusing and arbitrary system, this economic reality underscores the argument for creating clear and fair default rules to ensure equitable distribution of resources and obligations. The suggested nudges could help mitigate these economic disparities by providing greater protection for women after a separation. (by Philibert)\n\n\n\nEconomic prospects after divorce\n\nBy: Philibert\n\n\n“A woman’s economic prospects fall after divorce, whereas the prospects of the man increase.”(p.235)\n\nContext: The following quotation comes from the section Nudging couples of the chapter 15 Privitizing marriages. The section highlights the need to rethink choice architecture to better protect the most vulnerable, often women and children. In the current confusing and arbitrary system, this economic reality underscores the argument for creating clear and fair default rules to ensure equitable distribution of resources and obligations. The suggested nudges could help mitigate these economic disparities by providing greater protection for women after a separation.\nThe previous claim has been supported by various studies and research: Numerous studies have shown that women often experience a significant decline in their standard of living following a divorce. For example, a study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that women’s household income fell by an average of 41% after divorce, whereas men’s household income decreased by only about 23%. Other research suggests that women are more likely to face economic hardship post-divorce due to factors like lower average earnings, career interruptions, and a greater likelihood of having primary custody of children (Avellar and Smock 2005).\nBesides,men typically fare better economically after a divorce. While they also experience a decrease in household income, it is usually less severe compared to women. Additionally, men often have higher average incomes and greater career continuity, which helps mitigate the financial impact of divorce (McManus and DiPrete 2001). Some studies even suggest that men’s economic prospects can improve post-divorce as they may have fewer household expenses and obligations (McManus and DiPrete 2001).\nHowever, there are also some studies and perspectives that offer a more nuanced view or contradict the claim that women’s economic prospects always fall and men’s always rise after divorce.\nFirst, while acknowledging that women generally face economic declines post-divorce, their research also points out that the extent of economic hardship can vary significantly based on factors such as employment status, educational attainment, and presence of children (McKeever and Wolfinger 2001).\nMoreover, some research suggests that in households where both spouses are earners, the economic impact of divorce can be less severe for women. For instance, women with stable, well-paying jobs and higher educational levels may experience less financial decline after divorce (Avellar and Smock 2005).\nStudies also indicate that the economic outcomes of divorce can vary significantly depending on the country and social safety nets available. For example, in Scandinavian countries with robust social welfare systems, the economic impact on women post-divorce may be mitigated (Andreß et al. 2006).\nLastly, there is evidence that changing gender roles and increasing economic independence of women are altering the traditional economic impacts of divorce. More recent studies show that as women’s labor force participation increases and wage gaps decrease, the financial disparity between divorced men and women may lessen (Smock, Manning, and Gupta 1999).\nTo conclude, These studies suggest that while the general trend has been for women to face more significant economic challenges post-divorce, there are important variations based on employment, education, social policies, and evolving gender roles that can alter these outcomes.\n\n\nAre covenant married couples more traditional?\n\nBy: Ambre & Candice\n\n\n“Only about 1–3 percent of couples choose covenant marriage when it is available, and not surprisingly, couples who choose that option tend to be religious and to have a traditional view of marriage, child rearing, and divorce.”\n\nMarriage by covenant is seen as a means of controlling individual impulses to make couples last and create stability within the family. Yet it is becoming easier and easier to leave this “contract”.\nThis part of the book is based on a study by Steven L. Nock et al titled ‘Covenant Marriage Turns Five Years Old’ published in 2003. In this paper, the authors describe their study that was conducted by surveying 536 couples (241 covenant married couples and 295 standard married couples).\nIn the initial study, they found that 10% of standard couples would have wanted a covenant marriage which does not correspond to what is said in “Nudge “(1/3%). They also found that 30% of standard married couples did not care about what kind of marriage they had while only 3/9% of covenant couples said that.\nThey found that overall covenant married couples were more religious than standard married ones : 20% of covenant married couples met each other at church while only 6% of standard married couples met that way. Moreover, they found that covenant married couples were more likely to pray more often and to go to church more frequently.\nHowever, there is a difference in the religions of people in standard marriages and in covenant couples. Catholic couples choose standard marriage more (30% of standard couples are catholic and 6/9% of covenant married couples are catholic) and Baptist, Protestant couples tend to choose covenant marriages more (1/2 of covenant married couples are Baptist and 1/3 of standard married couples are Baptist). Those differences are not mentioned in Nudge.\nThe quote in Nudge is partially true, more people choose and want covenant marriage than what is said in the book but they are indeed more traditional and religious.\nTo add on, there are less covenant marriages nowadays and it is becoming more and more controversial. The rate of covenant marriages in states that allow it is now at 0.5%.\nReferences\n\nNock.S & Wilson.J (2013) Covenant Marriage Turns Five Years Old.

Federal law benefits married couples through a number of entitlement programs. Under the Family and Medical Leave Act, for example, an employer must allow unpaid leave to a worker who seeks to care for a spouse; it need not do so for “partners.”3 State laws often grant similar advantages to members of married couples.”(p.216)\n\nIn fact, the Family and Medical Leave Act does require employers to pay employees who have to look after a sick partner. «The FMLA entitles eligible employees of covered employers to take unpaid, job-protected leave for specified family and medical reasons with continuation of group health insurance coverage under the same terms and conditions as if the employee had not taken leave. Eligible employees are entitled to: Twelve workweeks of leave in a 12-month period for : […] to care for the employee’s spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health condition; » https://www.momjunction.com/articles/benefits-of-marriage_00662978/\nOne benefit of marriage could be a better health “research suggesting that married people enjoy better health than single people”, they tend to “live longer, have fewer strokes and heart attacks, have a lower chance of becoming depressed, be less likely to have advanced cancer at the time of diagnosis and more likely to survive cancer for a longer period of time, survive a major operation more often” however only one study is quoted “Marriage could improve heart attack survival and reduce hospital stay “ from university of East Anglia. https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-health-advantages-of-marriage-2016113010667\nLegal benefits of marriage, such as the “Right To Sue Someone On The Deceased’s Behalf”, or the “Right To Determine Last Rites And Funeral”, there are also financial benefits such as the share of a common bank account, or the Social Security Payouts https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.500887.\nReferences\n\nRibar, D.

    "text": "Healthcare before part D\n\nBy: Clémence B.\n\n\n“Before Part D, about half of all American seniors—approximately twenty-one million—had some form of prescription drug coverage through private plans or a government source such as the Department of Veterans Affairs.”\n\nFirst, what is Medicare Part D ?\nMedicare Part D is a voluntary benefit offered by private insurance companies to cover some or all of the cost of many prescription drugs.\n“Original Medicare covers some drugs that might be administered in a hospital or doctor’s office setting, but Part D covers the kinds of drugs you might pick up from the pharmacy. If you’re signed up for a Medicare supplement plan, that also works alongside your Part D prescription drug plan,” explains Whitney Stidom, vice president of Medicare operations with eHealth Inc., a health insurance broker and online resource provider headquartered in Santa Clara, California.\nBased on data, the fact is accurrate. Before the introduction of Part D, about half of seniors had some form of prescription drug coverage. This coverage came from various sources, including employer-sponsored retiree plans, Medicaid, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and other state programs​​. Estimates indicate that approximately 21 million seniors had such coverage prior to Part D (KFF). This left the other half of seniors, roughly another 21 million, without consistent and comprehensive drug coverage, highlighting the need for the implementation of Medicare Part D to fill this gap.\nWe could however criticize the fact that those plans should not have to be purchased indeed an access to healthcare should not be a field where there is so much inequalities due to wealth. Healthcare should be accessible by all.\n\n\nBush and the Medicare plan “Part D”\n\nBy: Jules\n\n\nThree years later, President Bush’s version passed on a narrow vote in Congress. […] Bush’s plan created a half-trillion-dollar federal subsidy for prescription drug coverage called Part D. “The reason why we felt it was necessary to provide choices is because we want the system to meet the needs of the consumer,” President Bush told a clubhouse of Florida seniors in 2006, with the plan’s rollout under way. “The more choices you have, the more likely it is you’ll be able to find a program that suits your specific needs. In other words, one-size-fits-all is not a consumer-friendly program. And I believe in consumers, I believe in trusting people.” (p.91)\n\nThree different facts needs to be verified here :\n\nThe vote for the “Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization act” was very close indeed: 216 votes for, 215 votes against, 1 abstention and 3 non-voters\nThe drug assistance and other provisions of the law are projected to cost taxpayers at least $395 billion, and possibly as much as $534 billion, over the next decade (Oliver, Lee, and Lipton 2004).\nPresident Bush actually uttered these sentences on Tuesday, May 9, 2006, between 11am and noon, at the Kings Point Clubhouse, Sun City Center, Florida, to a gathering of people over the age of fifty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nOliver, Thomas R, Philip R Lee, and Helene L Lipton. 2004. “A Political History of Medicare and Prescription Drug Coverage.” The Milbank Quarterly, June. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0887-378X.2004.00311.x.",

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nChapter 6 explores a behavioral intervention aimed at increasing retirement savings. Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein describe the Save More Tomorrow (SMarT) program, which they designed to help individuals overcome the common challenge of inadequate retirement savings. The main idea of the SMarT program is to prioritize behavioral economics principles, recognizing that people are often resistant to making immediate changes but are more open to committing to future adjustments. The program encourages employees to pre-commit to allocating a portion of their future salary increases towards their retirement savings. Firstly, inertia plays a significant role, as people tend to stick with default options. By automatically increasing contributions with each salary raise, the program takes advantage of this tendency, ensuring that employees continue to save more over time. Secondly, loss aversion, the concept that people are more sensitive to losses than gains, is addressed by timing the increase in contributions with salary raises. This approach ensures that employees do not perceive a reduction in their take-home pay, making them more comfortable with saving more. Lastly, the program helps with self-control issues by avoiding present-biased preferences, where immediate consumption is often prioritized over long-term savings. By committing to future savings, employees can better align their actions with their long-term financial goals In summary, “Save More Tomorrow” offers a practical solution to improve retirement savings by leveraging human behavioral tendencies. (by Ambre, Micaela, Candice & Lou-Anne)\n\n\n\nCan saving strategies solve retirement problems?\n\nBy: Sarah & Clémence\n\n\n“Americans would be better able to deal with this problem if they were saving more on their own” (p.103).\n\nIn this part “Saves more tomorrow”, the author discusses challenges in retirement savings for Americans and proposes solutions to encourage participation in saving plans. Therefore, he claimed that “Americans would be better able to deal with this problem if they were saving more on their own” (p.103). What if solving Social Security’s problems was the way to help Americans save? Social Security in the US is a government program that provides financial assistance to disabled, retired, or unemployed individuals and their families. It’s funded through payroll taxes and gives benefits such as retirement income and disability payments. Those payroll taxes are known as FICA (federal insurance contributions Act), both employees and employers pay a percentage of their wages in social security. The current social security tax is 6,2% for employees and 6.2% for employers. To determine the benefits, you will get when retired, social security takes your top 35 years of earnings adjusted to inflation. In 2020, the average retired worker gets around 1500 dollars a month from social security. Moreover, Gallup research shows that some 57% of retirees say that social security is a major source of their income in retirement. For over 30 years it was full of cash. But since 2010, the payroll taxes haven’t been enough to cover benefit payments because of the retirement of the baby boomers and the fact that people live longer now. So currently social security pays more in benefits than it receives in revenues. The problem is that Americans think that social security will be able to pay a benefit once they are eligible according to [@ Barry Bosworth, Gary Burtless]” THE AMERICAN SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM does not have enough resources to pay for all benefits promised under current law”. Therefore, the author in this part focuses on the ways to encourage Americans to save but it would be better to start by solving the social security system.\nSome solutions proposed by (CNBC?, how social security works) to fix social security: -”Increased the payroll taxes” -”Increase the wages base that payroll taxes are applied to” -”Subject earnings to a higher cap or even all earnings to the payroll tax rate” -”Flat reduction in benefits” -”Increase the retirement age”\n\n\nDo employees throw away retirement money?\n\nBy: Ambre & Careylha\n\n\n“One extreme example comes from the United Kingdom, where some defined-benefit plans do not require any employee contributions and are fully paid for by the employer. They do require employees to take action to join the plan. Data on twenty-five such plans reveal that scarcely half of the eligible employees (51 percent) signed up! 4 This is equivalent to not bothering to cash your paycheck.” (p.108)\n\nWe can actually explain this better with multiple arguments(https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp)\n\nFirst, most employers switched to defined-contribution plans (DC) instead of defined-benefit plans (DB) because they were less costly for the employer and presented less risks. In fact, in a DB, the employee has no control over the benefits and the result is very uncertain, which can deter them from signing up.\nSecond, when enrolled in a DB, employees struggle to change jobs while keeping their benefits because they are directly linked to their employer by that plan. Changing jobs would compromise the benefits of their DB.\n\nToday, it seems that most of the 25% of employees who have access to defined-benefit plans do participate. Note that DB plans are not accessible to everybody. Therefore, globally the major reason for why people don’t enroll in DB is because they are not elligible. So, for the vast majority of people, not enrolling in a DB is not like “not bothering to cash a paycheck” and can not be explained by just a lack of will.",

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThis chapter examines Bush’s proposal to partially privatize Social Security, similar to Sweden’s system, where payroll taxes would go into individual savings accounts. Sweden’s plan emphasized choice, offering many fund options and encouraging active selection. However, many chose poorly, resulting in higher fees and lower returns compared to the well-designed default fund. This highlights the need for better nudges in Social Security reform to guide better investment decisions. (by Marion S.)\n\n\n\nAre women more organized?\n\nBy: Marion S. & Anaïs\n\n\n(We have a theory about why women were more likely to make active choices: we think that women were less likely to lose the enrollment forms, and more likely to remember to mail them in. We admit to having no data to support this theory, and plead guilty to the possibility that we are being overly influenced—via the availability bias—by the fact that our significant others are considerably more organized than we are.)”(p.159)\n\n\nIn this excerpt, the author acknowledges that he’s not relying on data, but on biases specific to his environment. We therefore sought to verify that women are indeed more involved in administrative tasks than me .\nAccording to a survey including 6875 tenure and tenure-track faculty at 140 US institutions, female academics reported to spend, on average, o.6 hours more per week than males on admin. Another survey covering 1378 faculty, women perform 12.4 admin activities per year, compared to men who just do 10.9. This shows that women may be more used to manage administrative work, to which we could associate active choices of the study. From this, we mightassume that—as the authors say–women are less likely to lose the enrolment forms, and more likely to remember to mail them in because they are more used to that kind of work (ex: administrative work) than men.\nThe research by Richard Hoggart, Olivier Schwartz, and Bernard Lahire underscores the pivotal role that women play in handling administrative and domestic tasks in traditional working-class families. Hoggart’s studies in Leeds, spanning the 1930s to 1950s, revealed that mothers were mainly responsible for managing interactions with institutions, often facing long waits and disrespect from staff. Schwartz, examining large residential areas in the 1980s, found that mothers took a leading role in dealing with institutions. This was a key part of their maternal duties, encompassing both the “charge” and “government” of the family, where they held control over domestic matters. In La raison des plus faibles (1993), Bernard Lahire highlighted the significant role women play in domestic record-keeping, including managing accounts, using calendars, creating to-do lists, and other forms of household organization. Mothers functioned as the family’s memory, exhibiting a strong tendency towards planning and rational management of the home. More recent studies, such as that by Yasmin Siblot, confirm this and emphasize this phenomenon in lower-middle-class families. There’s a paradox here: women haven’t always taken care of administrative tasks. Less than a century ago, women couldn’t even have a bank account. It seems obvious that women are not naturally predisposed to administrative tasks, but that culture has forced it upon them.\n\nFinally, using their personal experience in this context as an argument is not without consequences: stereotypes are self-fulfilling, as numerous studies confirm for example, the study carried out by Steel & al in 20192 shows how intellectual performance can be affected by stereotypes. . By asserting this, the authors are not only influencing themselves not to change their personal situation, but they are also contributing to the transmission of this stereotype.\nReferences\n\nGal, D., & Rucker, D.

We found one study, in the field of online purchase contracts, that supports the claim that there is a minority of people (0.2%) who read the contract (at least one second) over 48,154 visitors to 90 software companies (Bakos, Marotta-Wurgler, and Trossen, n.d.). Another study found that of over 92 students, only 4% (4/92) read their electronic contracts “as a general matter” (Eigen 2011). However, studies mitigate his statement in showing that it is not the “majority” that do not read the contract. In the study cited before, only 44% of students do not read them at all (Eigen 2011). Moreover, in another study, only 28.9% of the sample did not review the contract at all (Hillman, n.d.), even if it does mention that the mean time of term contract reading is relatively short, ~1min 20 seconds.\n\n\nAre people gullible?\n\nMarion\n\n\n“Similarly misleading mail solicitations come from private lenders, aimed at a younger audience. Some of these solicitations are hilarious in their absurdity, but apparently they’re effective too”(p.138)\n\nContext: The rise of the cost of going to college has pushed people to borrow more. But it has put students and their families exposed to sources of fraudulent loans.\nThe authors state that people are vulnerable to institutions that are trying to rip them off, so I am going to see if people are gullible.\n\nIn fact multiple commissions had warned the population about those fraud campaign for example The Federal Trade Commission made tracks to warn about scammers who more likely would target borrowers, perhaps posing as U.S. Department of Education personnel\nPeople are in fact sometimes being duped, but the fear of people about misinformation is often not justified. “The scientific literature suggest that many of them are Exaggerated” (Altay and Acerbi, n.d.)\nFinally a study demonstrates that even if we could think that we can be influenced by many sources of information, including new digital techniques, we are in fact adapted to critically evaluate information we are exposed to : “Converging evidence reveals that communication is much less influential than often believed” (Mercier 2017)\n\nMore broadly, according to “The i-frame and the s-frame” article (Chater and Loewenstein 2023), in the USA sending children to private school is an important financial sacrifice. The fact that people decline public schools to private ones creates a vicious circle. The real danger then shown is the fact that changes from i-level give false hope and prevent systemic change.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAltay, Sacha, and Alberto Acerbi. n.d. “Misinformation Is a Threat Because (Other) People Are Gullible.” https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/n4qrj.\n\n\nBakos, Yannis, Florencia Marotta-Wurgler, and David R.

The author give hints on where to invest, the risks to take, the dangerousity of investing in its own company, its opinion on retirement plans and so on. He developped on how nudges and choice architecture impact investors choices, such as default investment plans (by Guilhem)\n\n\n\nPeople invest in mutual funds\n\nGaspard & Lou-Anne\n\n\n“In retirement accounts, most investors do not choose stocks individually but rather invest via mutual funds.” (p.119)\n\n\nIt’s hard to find actual numbers as the number of people investing in mutual funds fluctuate with the market and as it exists many mutual funds.\nHowever, the claim seems to be broadly accurate\nIn the fact-check, I focus on a specific kind of investment, namely retirement fonds. According to the federal reserve, 36% of retirement savings come at least from IRA which is a mutual fund. At first place, with 55% comes defined contribution plans which are retirement plans where the employer, employee, or both make regular contributions of specified amounts. Many popular plans are defined contribution plans, such as the 401(k), 457, and 403(b) plans. Mutual funds are the most common investment option offered in 401(k) plans.\nWe also found that investors’ choices also depend a lot on individuals profils, most notably their income level and age that greatly influence their decisions, according to a paper published in the Journal of consumer affairs by Hazel Bateman & al. This study show that the reaction of retirement savers to risk and return attributes differed significantly across our sample and was related to age and income level In addition, investors typically compared nearby investment options when deciding on their most preferred choice and displayed cross-effects consistent with their taste for net returns and their degree of risk aversion.\n\nReferences https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2024-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2023-retirement-investments.htm https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1745-6606.2010.01178.x?casa_token=RSi15EK4J28AAAAA%3ACIhkGUK3tK4V_DkqT6VrtpaRW_a7RCBQypMQmgoldEzHAIscvb-uTadtJ_CbQZeqPw_nYRZW9t-00Q\n\n\nAuto-enrolment to achieve adequate saving rates\n\nGuilhem & Anouk\n\n\n“Expect Error To help those who would not get it together to join, we encourage automatic enrollment, which we would combine with Save More Tomorrow to help people achieve an adequate savings rate. For those who did not invest in a life-cycle fund, we would recommend offering an automatic rebalancing plan so that a participant’s asset allocation would be adjusted over time” (p.130)\n\nAuto-enrollment and auto-escalation are among the most ingenious and elegant i-frame interventions in any domain. Yet their impact has been disappointing, despite often being seen as the major success story for behavioral public policy. David Laibson, once a leading advocate of i-frame solutions, concluded in a 2020 keynote that neither auto-enrollment nor auto-escalation have moved the needle on retirement saving (Chater and Loewenstein 2023)\nFirst, even without auto-enrollment, many employees end up enrolling in the firms’ retirement plans; auto-enrollment only slightly accelerates the process (Choi et al. 2004).Second, and more significant, is the problem of “leakage” : Employees often remove funds from retirement savings accounts, for example, when changing jobs, or borrow at low interest rates using their retirement balances as loan collateral (Argento, Bryant, and Sabelhaus 2015). Third, auto-enrollment cannot help the many workers at companies which don’t offer matches or provide no plan at all, which is especially true in the small companies and firms. Auto-enrollment in retirement plans fails to benefit workers at companies that do not offer matching contributions or any retirement plans at all, a problem particularly prevalent among small businesses. This limitation highlights the need for broader solutions to increase retirement savings participation among employees in small firms (The Pew Charitable Trusts, 2017).\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nArgento, Robert, Victoria L.

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nIn the recent year the public attention has been focused on international problems and climate change. Even though some governmental measures were successful, many have only aggravated the problem. In this domain freedom of choice has hardly been the guiding principle. Markets that are parts of the choice architecture systems face two problems that contribute to environmental problems: improperly aligned incentives and absence of the feedback on environmental consequences of actions, appropriate nudges should be implemented to solve these problems. Ambient Orb is an example of feedback nudge. (by Sofia)\n\n\n\nAmbient Orb and energy consumption\n\nBy: Sofia and Julia\n\n\n“Clive Thompson (2007) has explored the efforts of Southern California Edison to encourage its consumers to conserve energy—and its creative, nudgelike solution. Past attempts to notify people of their energy use with emails or text messages did no good, but what worked was to give people an Ambient Orb, a little ball that glows red when a customer is using lots of energy but green when energy use is modest. In a period of weeks, users of the Orb reduced their use of energy, in peak periods, by 40 percent. That flashing red ball really gets people’s attention and makes them want to use less energy.”(p.194)\n\n\nIn their paper The i-frame and the s-frame: How focusing on individual-level solutions has led behavioral public policy astray, Chater and Loewenstein, denounce a BP campaign that promotes using the i-frame by helping individuals reduce their own personal carbon footprint (Chater and Loewenstein 2023) . It makes people believe climate issues must be addressed through a change in individual behaviour. Here it is the same (criticizable) idea,”people are consuming too much energy, we give them a light that shows this to them, and the problem is solved”\nThere is no information about studies on efficiency of Ambient Orb on the website that produced Ambient Orb, the name of the product since then.\nArticles in the Web that talk about Ambient Orb cite Thaler and Sunstein; Thaler and Sunstein cite Thompson; Thomson cites Martinez. So, we observe a chain of citations and further research raises some questions: not only Thaler and Sunstein cite Thomson, but also other researchers, such as Holmes, for example. Citation in Holmes’ article makes it possible for us to find the article of Thompson. The first thing that we observe is that the article is printed in WIRED. WIRED is a monthly American magazine that focuses on how emerging technology affects culture, the economy and politics. There is no indication that WIRED is a research journal. A citation from this article is provided: “So Martinez bought an Ambient Orb and the hacking began. Martinez realized he could use the Orbs to signal changes in electrical rates, programming them to glow green when the grid was underused — and, thus, electricity cheaper — and red during peak hours when customers were paying more for power. He bought 120 Orbs, retrofitted them to glow based on the dynamic California electrical grid, then handed them out for free to his biggest energy consumers, and awaited the results. Within weeks, Orb users reduced their peak-period energy use by 40 percent. Why? Because, Martinez explains, the glowing sphere was less annoying and more persistent than a text alert.”It’s nonintrusive,” he says. “It has a relatively benign effect. But when you suddenly see your ball flashing red, you notice.”\nThe reasonable question is where we can find Martinez’s scientific article. Thomson doesn’t provide any reference including the name of study or the link to it. Moreover, he doesn’t even include any tables or figures in his study.\nAccording to the article by Thompson, Martinez is a Southern California Edison power station manager. (we can’t provide any direct citations from Holmes without her consent, according to copyright policy)\n\nConclusion:\n\nWe found it impossible to find the scientific work of Martinez. Having checked the retraction database, we also didn’t find any information about the article being retracted. We checked Google, Google Scholar ResearchGate and Academia.\nThus, either the article doesn’t exist, or we can’t find it. Nevertheless, the way in which Thomson represents “results” doesn’t make them trustworthy: no methodology, no data results, no p-values. Moreover, Martinez seems to be the only one to check Ambient Orb efficiency.\n\n\n\nClean air act and energy consumption\n\nBy: Teresa\n\n\n“Many of their actions have done a lot of good; efforts to reduce air pollution have prevented hundreds of thousands of premature deaths and millions of illnesses as well. “ In the United States, national emissions limitations imposed on major pollution sources have been the rule, not the exception. Such limitations have sometimes been effective; the air is much cleaner than it was in 1970.” (p437)\n\nContext: This chapter examines government efforts to protect the environment, focusing on strict regulations, particularly in the United States, where national emissions limitations have been imposed on major pollution sources. These measures have significantly reduced air pollution since 1970.\n\nIndeed, in the United States, a “Clean Air Act” was agreed in 1970 and allows the reduction in particulate air pollution alone. In the same year that saw the founding of Earth Day and the creation of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), President Nixon signed into law the Clean Air Act of 1970 (CAA) on December 31, ushering in what is arguably the most important and far-reaching environmental statute enacted in the United States. [https://www.resources.org/archives/looking-back-50-years-clean-air-act-1970 ]. This act passed by the congress established the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), setting maximum allowable concentrations of particulate matter, among other pollutants, created emissions standards for pollution sources, leading industrial facilities to install pollution control technologies and automakers to produce cleaner, more fuel-efficient vehicle and required each state government to devise its own plan for achieving and sustaining compliance with the standards[https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/united-states-clean-air-act-turns-50-air-any-better-half-century-later; https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-06/documents/contsetc.pdf]\nBy 1980, control of industrial emissions had led to a 50% decrease in particulate emissions, or a 20% decrease in ambient PM concentrations across the country. Today, on average, the PM2.5 pollution that Americans are exposed to is only 35.1 percent of what it was in 1970. [https://aqli.epic.uchicago.edu/policy-impacts/united-states-clean-air-act/#:~:text=With%2064.9%20percent%20less%20pollution,the%20average%20American%20since%201970.]\nClean Air Act programs have lowered levels of six common pollutants (particles, ozone, lead, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide) as well as numerous toxic pollutants.\nBetween 1990 and 2020, national concentrations of air pollutants improved 73 percent for carbon monoxide, 86 percent for lead (from 2010), 61 percent for annual nitrogen dioxide, 25 percent for ozone, 26 percent for 24-hour coarse particle concentrations, 41 percent for annual fine particles (from 2000), and 91 percent for sulfur dioxide. [epa.gov] [https://www.epa.gov/clean-air-act-overview/air-pollution-current-and-future-challenge]\nIndeed, efforts to reduce air pollution have prevented hundreds of thousands of premature deaths and millions of illnesses as well. Now, with 64.9 percent less pollution in the air, Americans are living healthier, with longer lives : 1.4 years have been added to the life expectancy of the average American since 1970. [https://aqli.epic.uchicago.edu/policy-impacts/united-states-clean-air-act/#:~:text=With%2064.9%20percent%20less%20pollution,the%20average%20American%20since%201970.]\n\nHowever, it’s important to highlight that even though the Clean Air Act has improved air quality, fifty years have passed since its introduction. Indeed, recent research has shown an increase in dangerous air pollution levels in recent years. Moreover, greenhouse gas emissions are now recognized as a danger to public health. Nevertheless, the United States still accounts for 13 percent of global greenhouse gases, and this percentage is still rising.\nReferences\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency. (2019).

This unanticipated consequence suggested that all by themselves, disclosure requirements might be able to produce significant emissions reductions.*”\n\nA disclosure statement is a document where companies have to reveal certain information to the public or government. For environmental laws, this often means reporting the types and amounts of toxic chemicals they release into the environment. The idea is that if companies have to make this information public, they will work harder to reduce harmful emissions to avoid looking bad.\nThe author is talking about the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA), a U.S. law from 1986. This law requires companies to report on how they store, use, and release hazardous substances. James Hamilton’s book talks about how just making this information public can lead to big reductions in toxic emissions because companies want to avoid bad publicity.\n\nWe fact-checked all references provided by the author as Hamilton, James. Regulation Through Revelation. New York: Cambridge University Press 2005 but we didn’t find this paper with free access on the internet.\nThe quote might oversimplify the mechanisms behind the reductions in toxic releases. While disclosure is a significant factor, other elements such as advances in technology, economic shifts, regulatory pressures, and corporate social responsibility initiatives also play crucial roles in reducing emissions.\nThe impact of disclosure requirements can vary significantly across different industries or even different regions. Some companies might respond promptly to public disclosure, while others might not be as affected. The quote does not account for this variability.\n\nReferences - https://books.google.fr/books?hl=en&lr=&id=rJLfrbrFYpsC&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=Hamilton,+James.+Regulation+Through+Revelation.+New+York:+Cambridge+University+Press,+2005-&ots=VsYx1bOkFY&sig=8mD_zz_4HV-u9JCqSJ0Yv6eWaVQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Hamilton%2C%20James.%20Regulation%20Through%20Revelation.%20New%20York%3A%20Cambridge%20University%20Press%2C%202005-&f=false - https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=350017064003086123065098108094101119065014088087016004031105066001080024062039106127044022037030002086125102065103004047030065085024078105020017064009126007081021018024079119127068112114083030127117094075080090070073092124006010116073095118110&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE - “Environmental Regulation and Innovation: Selective Survey of the Evidence” by Adam B.

As a result, emissions of carbon dioxide, the leading contributor to global warming, would decline. And if gas taxes were increased, automobile manufacturers would have plenty of incentives to develop new technologies to meet the demand for more fuel-efficient cars.”\n\nThis book was written in 2008, so policies that increase taxes on gasoline have been tried in the world. The results are not always in line with what the authors claim: E.g. in their study ”Effect of gasoline prices on car fuel efficiency: Evidence from Lebanon”, Walid Marrouch and Jana Mourad found no evidence that rising gasoline price shifted consumer’s demand toward more fuel-efficient cars.\nAlso, we can socially question such taxes. We can take the case of France to illustrate, where this raise in tax led to an important social movement: Yellow Jackets. The tax only affected the poor, who really needed their car to go work, and couldn’t afford to buy a new car. Indeed, gasoline is an inelastic good, so a rise in its price has a big social impact. In France, the protest was so high that the government finally had to go back and finally abandoned the tax.\nReferences\n\nMarrouch, W., & Mourad, J. (2019).

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nSchool choice has been a polarizing issue in American politics. The idea is that the competition improves education quality and combined with vouchers for impoverished people gives everyone a fair chance. There are those who accepts this idea and those should criticise it. School choice could be enhanced by helping parents and children making better choices , this is where nudges come at play. San Marcos initiative is told to nudge students towards applying to college. (by Sofia)\n\n\n\nWhy didn’t the educational program NCLB work ?\n\nBy: Sarah G. & Charlotte\n\n\n“By June 2003 twelve of Worcester’s fifty public schools had been labeled “in need of improvement” for two consecutive years, and five for three consecutive years. That summer, forty-seven hundred students, almost one-fifth the district’s student population, were eligible to transfer, and eighteen hundred students had the right to collect federal money for supplemental education services. But six months later, only one student had switched schools, and only two had taken advantage of supplemental services! Worcester officials themselves were primarily responsible.”\n\nThe author’s argument is mostly based on an article by William G. Howell (Sydney Stein Professor in American Politics in the Harris School and co-director of the Program on Political Institutions) published in Education Next (journal that provides news and research to bring evidence to bear on current education policy). In his book, the author then argues that the education program NCLB didn’t work and that this was the fault of the officials themselves. We hence want to fact-check his argument.\nIndeed, by relying on many sources, we found that the program didn’t work: “The impact of NCLB was supposed to be felt most strongly in urban centers with large minority and disadvantaged populations-places just like Worcester. Instead, during its first two years, NCLB appeared to have little impact at all ». In addition, we found that officials indeed discouraged families to transfer their child to better performing schools: “Ultimately, districts are responsible for informing parents of their rights and opportunities under NCLB. But given the challenges that Worcester faces, along with the incentives to safeguard public finances, it should come as no surprise that administrators subtly, and not so subtly, discouraged families from transferring their children out of underperforming schools.” More precisely, the district notified families through a letter at underperforming schools of their rights under NCLB. In their letter, officials noted that because of space limitations, they may not be able to transfer every child in a family to the same school. Also, they affirmed that families with children at underperforming schools who switch schools would forfeit their rights to supplemental services. Also they cited improvements of Worcester public schools. All these affirmations discouraged families to transfer their children to new school.\nRéférences :\n\nhttps://www.educationnext.org/one-child-at-a-time/\nFOUCAULT Marc, « « No child left behind » : entre espoir et déception », Administration & Éducation, 2017/3 (N° 155), p. 29-33.

In San Marcos, schools run on a tight budget, and two-thirds of high schoolers never experience higher education. The superintendent had no outside funding to implement the idea, so she asked her teachers and the community college for help… In the end, the nudge produced big results. From 2004 to 2005 the percentage of San Marcos High students who went to Texas colleges rose 11 percentage points, to 45 percent. (p.206)”\n\nWhat do we want to fact-check:\nWe want to find official data, plus, one can ask oneself how mindful is the choice of increased enrollment as a proxy for assessing nudge efficiency. Enrolling in a university doesn’t mean finishing it, thus, some additional data, such as the percentage of students that didn’t drop out the first year, would be helpful to better assess the situation.\nFact-check:\n\nHaving checked all references and bibliography provided by the author, as well as having searched this information on web (Google), Google scholar and a couple other search engines, we didn’t find any study on San Marcos high schools for the specified time period.\nThus, we concluded that the data might be directly taken from official Texas Education websites. San Marcos is situated in Texas in Hays county, there were several schools there in the studied period (2003-2005) : San Marcos High School ( school number 105902001) and Pride High School (school number 105902002, closed in 2010). According to report on the Texas Higher Education Data website, in 2003-2004 there were 306 highschool graduate students in San Marcos High School, from whom only 47 were enrolled in Texas colleges and 86 were enrolled in Texas universities; in Pride High School there were 89 high school graduates, from whom 6 were enrolled in a Texas College (Austin Community College). Thus, in 2004, around 13,4 % of high school graduates were enrolled in Texas colleges and 35,2 % of high school graduates were enrolled either in a college or a university in Texas. In 2004-2005 in San Marcos high school there were 316 high school graduates, from whom 47 were enrolled in Texas colleges and 80 were enrolled in Texas universities; in Pride High School there were 84 students and only 7 were enrolled in Texas Colleges (Austin Community College). 13,5 % of students were enrolled in Texas colleges and 33,5 % of students were enrolled either in a Texas College or University. So, we observe no significant increase in percentage of students enrolled in College (0,01), and we observe a decrease in the proportion of students enrolled in Texas universities and colleges. In the citation “colleges” presumably include both colleges and universities, otherwise percentages are too far from the described 45 %. As it can be seen in these two documents there are also other institutions mentioned (other pub/ind 4-yr or 2-yr institutions), if we include them into calculations, we observe that 41,5 % of students were enrolled in some institution in 2005 which is closer to the mentioned 45 in the cited paragraph. Nevertheless, according to citation, we should observe (45-11)=34% enrollment in 2004. If we include other pub/ind 4-yr or 2-yr institutions, we receive 44,6% enrolment in 2004. So, there percentage of students enrolled in some higher education institutions decreased, rather than increased.\n\nNote: We took a glance at the 2002-2003 report where there were 33,5 % of students enrolled in Texas colleges and universities (there is no division of school, they are united under the name of the district). Therefore, there was a positive change but between fall 2003 and 2004, not between fall 2004 and fall 2005. The data in fall 2004 and 2003 corresponds to the citation.\nIf our calculations are correct, this means that:\n\nEither the authors didn’t use the data we use, which is the official data of the Texas Higher Education data websites\nEither the data has been changed\nEither in 2005 the percentage, including other pub/ind 4-yr or 2-yr institutions was used (41,5 %), while in 2004 other pub/ind 4-yr or 2-yr institutions weren’t included (33,5%), which could create a gap described in the citation (still not 11 %)\n\nHere we provided possible criticism of the described nudge:\n\nThe citation makes it seem like the increase in college enrollment was solely due to the nudges. However, other factors could have played a role, such as broader educational initiatives, economic changes, or community support, which aren’t mentioned.\nThe program worked well at San Marcos High, but it might not be as effective in other schools with different demographics or fewer resources. Every school has unique challenges, so what works in one place might not work in another.\nThe citation says the superintendent had no outside funding and had to rely on existing resources. This could put a strain on those resources, making the program hard to sustain. Schools without community support might find it even harder to implement similar programs without extra funding.\n\nReferences\n\nTexas Higher Education Coordinating Board and Texas Education Agency,（2008), “Texas High School Graduates From FY 2005 Enrolled in Texas Public or Independent Higher Education Fall 2005” https://apps.highered.texas.gov/DocID/pdf%5C1161.pdf\nTexas Higher Education Coordinating Board and Texas Education Agency,（2008), “Texas High School Graduates From FY 2004 Enrolled in Texas Public or Independent Higher Education Fall 2004” https://apps.highered.texas.gov/DocID/pdf%5C0963.pdf\nTHED: High School Graduates Enrolled in Higher Education.

Test-score improvements can range from 1 to 7 percent a year depending on the school and student—and improvement is usually greatest among younger students, low-income students, and minority-group members.” (p.100)\n\nContext: In the chapter the authors discuss how to help parents choose schools for their children. School choice has mostly been an option only for rich people: children are usually assigned to the public school nearest their home. If the parents can afford it, they can avoid this assignment by sending their children to (expensive) private schools. In the 1950’s, based on ideas of the economist Milton Friedman, school choice should be made broadly available to everyone - and not only the rich. In the US, some states use or have at least at some point experimented with so-called “school vouchers”. There are also other school choice options allowing students to attend public school, such as charter schools, magnet schools, homeschooling, etc… Essentially, the state guarantees to pay tuition fees for students at a school of the parents’ choice, no matter if they choose public or private, religious or non-religious school options. Just after this quote, the authors try to make programs helping parents to make better choices, after being given this opportunity.\nArgument: The chapter is mostly on how to help parents make better choices. The authors take for granted that school choice is obviously a good thing: they self-identify as “libertarians”, who “are strongly inclined to support the concept of school choice” (p.100). Their argument in favor of school choice is that if parents can pick the school for their children, that will spur competition among schools. Competition will motivate schools to be better (because they have to outperform each other), ultimately resulting in better education for everyone. And if schools compete, those who are the least advantaged have the most to gain.\nFact-check: In the present quote, they present evidence in favor of the benefits of school choice. The study by Hoxby (2001) is, it seems, part of testing a privatization project in Michigan in the 1990s. A bunch of charter schools opened in Michigan, thereby increasing competition. As a consequence, economists did indeed observe better performance of children in public schools. But was it because competition made the schools better? Probably not. Instead, the composition of classes in public schools changed. Charter schools tended to take the lowest performing kids from public schools, in fact they found “that test scores of charter school students do not improve, and may actually decline, relative to those of public school students”. Unsurprisingly, the test scores at the public schools went up - their most struggling students were at other schools no. By contrast, performance at charter schools tended to drop, despite the increased competition, so the results suggest “that charter schools have had no significant effect on test scores in neighboring public schools”.\nMoreover, concerning voucher programs, a report by the Economic Policy Institute analyzes studies in several U.S. cities, the states of Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, and in Chile and India, finding “limited improvements at best in student achievement and school district performance from even large-scale programs. In the few cases in which test scores increased, other factors, namely increased public accountability, not private school competition, seem to be more likely drivers.” Supporting and strengthening neighborhood public schools with a menu of proven policies would be better for accomplishing these achievements.\nWe also have to take into account that actual performance of school choice programs - such as voucher or charter schools programs - is assessed only by students’ academic results. Maybe other ways of measuring have to be considered to avoid some spurious correlations, in studies, between programs and the U.S. achievements.",

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThis chapter explains how nudges help manage temptation by altering environments to guide better decisions. The concept of dynamic inconsistency shows that people often choose immediate gratification over long-term benefits, even against their initial preferences. Recognizing this, nudges can effectively curb immediate temptations and improve long-term outcomes. Effective self-control often requires external help, and well-designed nudges can bridge the gap between our impulsive actions and our goals (by Marion S.)\n\n\n\nPeople don’t eat Popcorn endlessly\n\nBy: Sophia & Marion S.\n\n\n“A few years ago, Brian Wansink and his colleagues ran an experiment in a Chicago movie theater in which moviegoers found themselves with a free bucket of stale popcorn? (It had been popped five days earlier and stored so as to ensure that it would actually squeak when eaten.) People were not specifically informed of its staleness, but they didn’t like the popcorn. As one moviegoer said,”It was like eating Styrofoam packing peanuts.” In the experiment, half of the moviegoers received a big bucket of popcorn and half received a medium-sized bucket. On average, recipients of the big bucket ate about 53 percent more popcorn-even though they didn’t really like it. After the movie, Wansink asked the recipients of the big bucket whether they might have eaten more because of the size of their bucket. Most denied the pos-sibility, saying, “Things like that don’t trick me.” But they were wrong.” (p.43)\n\n\nIn his study “Bad Popcorn in Big Buckets” Wansink doesn’t specify what effect was produced by the fact that popcorn was free\nSeveral studies of Wansink have been retracted and Wanink was accused of p-hacking. In the study about popcorn one of the reference article is “Super Bowls: Serving Bowl Size and Food Consumption” that has been retracted due to several reasons: investigation by company/institution, investigation by journal/publisher, misconduct, official Investigation/finding, misconduct by author, unreliable data, unreliable results, upgrade/update of prior notice. More than 40 works of Wansick were retracted.\nErrors were discovered in six other articles published by members of the Cornell Food and Brand Lab. 17 other articles authored or co-authored by Wansink have been retracted.\n\nIn September 2018, Cornell determined that Wansink had committed scientific misconduct and removed him from all teaching and research positions; he was only allowed to assist in investigations of his published work. He also resigned from the university, effective June 30, 2019.\nThus, given the sum of the factors, we can conclude that the article “Bad Popcorn in Big Buckets” fails to consider the fact that popcorn was free, that could have possibly influenced the results, plus its references contain a retracted article.\n\n\nStreet lights and energy savings\n\nBy: Nour\n\n\n“Along with having more time to enjoy an evening softball game, we end up saving energy too.” (p.47)\n\nContext: In this chapter, the author implies that saving daylight time is somehow a nudge. He affirms that people enjoy having more time in their day and quote statistical studies proving it.\nThere are several things that cause an issue here:\n\nThe author makes it sound like everyone benefits from this decision, and the tone suggests that people, individually, have better energy consumption. However, it is not our personal consumption of energy that is affected, only street lighting.\nMoreover, the fact that we save energy is not really true anymore. When it was first implemented (WWI, then in 1973), it indeed allowed saving. However practically all light bulbs in the street have been replaced by low consumption ones. In fact, a study even showed that the result obtained is the opposite of what we were trying to have: “Existing simulations suggest that DST increases electricity consumption on average over 224 different locations throughout the United States”\n\nTo conclude, with daylight savings, we - as citizens - do not save energy, and neither does the government.\nReferences\n\nKotchen, M.

    "text": "Nudges and practice\n\nBy: Careylha\n\n\n“Even hard problems become easier with practice… Unfortunately, some of life’s most important decisions do not come with many opportunities to practice… Generally, the higher the stakes, the less often we are able to practice. None of this is to say that the government should be telling people whom to marry or what to study. This is a book about libertarian paternalism. At this stage we just want to stress that rare, difficult choices are good candidates for nudges.”(p.74-75)\n\nThe author’s main argumentative structure here is to prove that rare and difficult choices are good candidates for nudges. To justify this, he uses the following argument:\n- if A: practice\n- then B: decision-making is better\n- not A then not B: then nudges\nBut:\n\nif A then B: in fact, it’s been proven time and again that practices make perfect. Indeed, it has been scientifically proven unsurprisingly, practicing a new skill does have an important role in the learning process (Ericsson, Krampe, and Tesch-Römer 1993). A better knowledge of a subject, or a better mastery of it, does indeed facilitate an individual’s decision-making.\nThe author’s argumentative structure exposes a flaw in logic, relying on the premise “not A then not B therefore nudges.” The primary issue lies in the lack of explanation regarding why nudges are deemed necessary when practice is impossible. While the author elaborates on how increased practice leads to better mastery and decision-making, particularly in complex situations like job or university decisions, they fail to address the fundamental question: “Why does a situation lacking repetition automatically require the implementation of nudges?” Without a clear demonstration of the link between the absence of practice and the necessity of nudges, the author’s argument loses validity. \nIndeed, there exist numerous scenarios where individuals make decisions without prior practice or external nudges. Consider, for instance, the task of choosing a present for a friend, a situation unfamiliar to many. Despite lacking experience in this specific decision-making process, individuals often rely solely on their knowledge of the friend’s preferences and interests, bypassing the need for external guidance or nudges.\nWhile the author emphasizes the benefits of practice for better decision-making, they overlook the fact that individuals are capable of making informed choices even in situations devoid of practice, rendering the automatic reliance on nudges unnecessary and unsubstantiated.\nFurthermore, the author lacks precision in their statements.They argue that nudges are necessary in complex situations, but they don’t take the time to define what is meant by complex situations.\nLastly, this advice raises a major question, which is: “to which extent is it ethical to uses nudges to guide an individual in a situation ?” Indeed, through its argumentation, the author lacks precision on the ethical aspect of nudges. He focuses the reader’s opinion on the concept of the complex situation rather than on the real ethical question of the latter.\n\n\n\nSelf-control\n\nBy: Anaïs & Sarah\n\n\n“We have seen that predictable problems arise when people must make decisions that test their capacity to self-control.”\n\nSelf-control is the ability to manage one’s thoughts, emotions, impulses and behavior to achieve long-term goals. What is important to keep in mind is that self-control is not stable, and it fluctuates all the time.\nThere are different types of self-control: - Impulse control: it is the faculty to be able to stop and think before doing something - Emotional control: it is the ability to control feelings\n- Self-control of concentration: the capacity to stay focus for a certain period of time\nOn the one hand, we could compare self-control to some limited resource or energy, such that engaging self-control quickly consumes our inner capacity, leaving us in a state of “ego depletion”. In this depleted state, further attempts at self-control are prone to failure. When we engage in a motivationally demanding activity at time 1, performance typically deteriorates on a different task at time 2, which could explain why we fail.\nSelf-control failure can also be about the motivated switching of task priorities from “have-to” to “want-to”. An example could be thinking about stopping smoking. When you have a lack of self-control, you will probably go from “I have to stop smoking” to “I want to stop smoking”. This way, you will keep this idea of stopping smoking, but pushing back this idea. Delaying gratification is also an important part of self-control, it is the ability to wait to get what you want. Delayed gratification means setting aside short-term desires in favor of long-term rewards. In this sense, self-control is not a guarantee of success in anything, because of this process by which we can change the order of our priorities.\nHowever, Inzlicht, Schmeichel and Macrae question the concept of a limited resource in “Why self-control seems (but may not be) limited”(https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-07542-008). According to them, this vision (seeing self-control as a limited resource) could be simplistic and doesn’t consider the complexity of this concept. But, several studies highlight the influence of different factors ( beliefs, social expectations, psychological state of mind) on the exhaustion of self-control. Therefore considering self-control as a limited resource seems to be right.\n\n“For investment goods, most people err on the side of doing too little.”\n\nThe author’s point of view is that most people lack self-control. But it is more complex than this.\nExerting self-control also represents costs to bear and sacrifices for one. Tradeoffs need to be made. For example, if you are very tired, it would be less easy to exert self-control and continue doing your homework than if you are not really tired (http://homepages.se.edu/cvonbergen/files/2013/01/Is-There-a-Downside-to-Good-Self-control_2009-annotated.pdf).\nWe should thus keep in mind that the exhaustion of self-control is influenced by many factors such as how costly it is and what environment we are in - it is different among individuals.\nWhy do some people have more self-control than others? Self-control is not primarily about restraining oneself from certain behaviors but rather about directing one’s actions towards specific goals. When you have a goal, it will be easier to resist temptations and inhibit impulses. In his article entitled “Self-Control: A function of Knowing What to Do, Not Knowing What Not to Do”, Fujita introduces the concept of “goal activation” as a key mechanism underlying self-control. He suggests that by focusing on goal activation rather than inhibition, we could develop more effective strategies for improving self-control and achieving desired outcomes.\n“We emphasize the idea that the present-oriented behaviors of the constellation are a contextually appropriate response to structural and ecological factors rather than a pathology or a failure of willpower.”(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28073390/). This quote suggests that self-control is not random and can be influenced by socioeconomic status, because individuals with a lower socioeconomic status will tend to maximize early benefits rather than future ones. In addition, since they are already limited in terms of resources, self-control is not even necessary.\nSo, we cannot give an answer to the question: Do people lack self-control? The reason why is the fact that it depends on multiple factors, such as motivation, social influences, the environment we are in and more. Nudge might be a way to give strength for people lacking in self-control.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nEricsson, K. Anders, Ralf T.
