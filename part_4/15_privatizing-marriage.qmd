 “A woman’s economic prospects fall after divorce, whereas the prospects of the man increase.”(p.235)

The previous claim has been supported by various studies and research:
- Economic Impact on Women: Numerous studies have shown that women often experience a significant decline in their standard of living following a divorce. For example, a study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that women's household income fell by an average of 41% after divorce, whereas men's household income decreased by only about 23%. Other research suggests that women are more likely to face economic hardship post-divorce due to factors like lower average earnings, career interruptions, and a greater likelihood of having primary custody of children.
- Economic Impact on Men: Men typically fare better economically after a divorce. While they also experience a decrease in household income, it is usually less severe compared to women. Additionally, men often have higher average incomes and greater career continuity, which helps mitigate the financial impact of divorce. Some studies even suggest that men's economic prospects can improve post-divorce as they may have fewer household expenses and obligations.

However, there are also some studies and perspectives that offer a more nuanced view or contradict the claim that women's economic prospects always fall and men's always rise after divorce.

- Research by Avellar and Smock (2005): While acknowledging that women generally face economic declines post-divorce, their research also points out that the extent of economic hardship can vary significantly based on factors such as employment status, educational attainment, and presence of children.
- Studies on Economic Independence and Dual-Earner Couples: Some research suggests that in households where both spouses are earners, the economic impact of divorce can be less severe for women. For instance, women with stable, well-paying jobs and higher educational levels may experience less financial decline after divorce.
- Variations Based on Geographical and Social Contexts: Studies indicate that the economic outcomes of divorce can vary significantly depending on the country and social safety nets available. For example, in Scandinavian countries with robust social welfare systems, the economic impact on women post-divorce may be mitigated.
- Emerging Trends and Changing Gender Roles: There is evidence that changing gender roles and increasing economic independence of women are altering the traditional economic impacts of divorce. More recent studies show that as women’s labor force participation increases and wage gaps decrease, the financial disparity between divorced men and women may lessen.

These studies suggest that while the general trend has been for women to face more significant economic challenges post-divorce, there are important variations based on employment, education, social policies, and evolving gender roles that can alter these outcomes.
